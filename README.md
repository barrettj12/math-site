# math-site
From 2019 to 2021, I kept a WordPress website detailing my mathematical activities. I left academia at the end of 2021, and so I decided to retire my old website. To avoid continual hosting & domain name costs, I've created a static copy and placed it in this repo (in the `/docs/` subfolder). The site is now served statically using GitHub Pages.

You can view the website (as it was) [here](https://barrettj12.github.io/math-site/).
